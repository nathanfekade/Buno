TO CHECK

!!!!! seller must not directly go to sellerpage we must first check if its verified when they login

!!! must do admin page

check there is no null (https://www.w3schools.com/php/php_form_url_email.asp)

check if it is an email(https://www.w3schools.com/php/php_form_url_email.asp)

when reloading a page it gives an error because it tries to send the data again so check

I think we should add the finalprice on the convob table and take the last rows value each time

the place where i echo to check if it is a seller or buyer sometimes echos a value on and i dont know what it is.

fix where i selected all rows and only use the rows i need

check the varchar for every attribute

and fix issue of autincrement and of default and unique

for checking if it is a buyer or seller image 22 on telegram 

fixes buyer.php by inserting into the table by using the constructor not passing arguments to the function and also check if username and email are available from both tables

check all databases are closed

check if the file is pdf only or image only  or other types according to the problem i think its in traversy php tutorial video

if possible creditcard verification

change connect class values to constant

when entering password let the image be .. so that the password won't be visible and if possible add and eye label that makes the password visible when we touch it

fix event litsener on javascript

i didn't use the filepath when uploading file in the sellerverification page do i need to (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Hz5WanrhuE)

when deleting  a file path from the database how do i also delete its folder

change the icon from the local host to our own

how is tabindex done and check all of them

sometimes the word on comes on the signup page where i displayed to check if it is seller or buyer
